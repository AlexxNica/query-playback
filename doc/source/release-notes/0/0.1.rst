======================
 Percona Playback 0.1
======================

This is the initial release and it's very limited. It should be considered Alpha.

Features:
---------
- slow query log parsing
- mysql client library
- one thread per client thread
- basic report as to how the replay went
- "as fast as possible" playback only. If query execution takes less time on playback server than original one, percona-playback will not pause.

Notable missing features:
-------------------------
- wall-time playback: ability to have the same amount of real-world time pass (i.e. a gap of 10seconds between queries will be preserved).
- parsing of general query log
